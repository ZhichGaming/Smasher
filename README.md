# Smasher - Spanish Exercise Automation Chrome Extension

Smasher is a Chrome extension that helps you automate your SmashEducation exercises. With Smasher, you can breeze through your exercises without wasting time typing the same answers repeatedly. This extension does not work for all exercises. **I do not take any responsability for you getting in trouble with your teacher if you get found out.**

## How to Install
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the Chrome browser
3. Go to chrome://extensions/
4. Enable the Developer mode in the top right corner
5. Click on Load unpacked and select the smasher directory

## How to Use

Once the extension is installed, it will automatically detect when you are on a SmashEducation exercise page. When you start an exercise, Smasher will prompt you to record your answers from an alert. Press enter to fill in the answers and escape to cancel.

### Chromebook Instructions

You Chromebook users can't install extensions since your school blocked it (at least my school did for mine) so here's how you guys can use it.

1. Open your page where there are questions you want to answer.
2. Right click anywhere and click inspect.
3. Go into the console tab.
4. Paste the code from the smasheducation.js file.
5. Repeat for every question.

I know this is much harder but you don't really have a choice... Or you know, you could just do your homework without cheating ðŸ˜‰

## Features
Answer filling: Smasher fills in SmashEducation questions if the exercise is supported through an alert confirmation.
